Here you can find two data files:

* **model.txt**: It is a simulation made with a numerical weather prediction model in a mountainous area in the Alps.

* **mast.txt**: It is a fake file created from the **model.txt** using random lags and random noise values 
to create a 10 minute frequency time series. Most of the columns are invalid.
